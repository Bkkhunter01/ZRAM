<h1 align="center"><b> About zRAM or Swap </b></h1> 

# ZRAM
Basically compresses unused apps within the system RAM. This allows the system to swap less needed processes to the Zram partition for faster access at a later time, instead of killing them. This does take up some of your ram though, so I imagine that the value you are setting is determining exactly what percentage of your ram that the zram partition is allotted.

# SWAP
Instead uses a small portion of the SDcard like RAM. The phone will attempt to keep as much within the ram as possible until fill, and then begin using the swap partition on the SDcard. At that point, the phone will begin moving inactive blocks of memory to the SD, freeing up RAM for active processes. If one of the pages on the SD needs to be accessed again, it will be moved back into RAM, and a different inactive page in RAM will be moved onto the SD ('swapped').
